**snake3d**

The game starts opening the file snake3d.html
At the beginning it should lag because it has to draws up all the objects.

The game has 3 different views:

1. **Perspective**: default view from a side of the board
2. **On Top**: view from the top of the board, the game will looks like a snake2d
3. **Point Of View (POV)**: view from the snake head

Pressing 'v' it's possible to chage the view.

The snake direction is controllable by the directional arrows.

In POV the snake can turn left or right, so only the lateral directional arrows work.
